****************** Project PA5 **********************

This is Project PA5, a model loader using Assimp. The loader also allows for coloring of the model. This project is for the group with members Jay Thom, Patrick Kelley, and Brian Gaunt. There is a model of a gameboard titled gameboard.obj in the bin folder, along with it's accompanying gameboard.mtl file. This can be used to test the functionality of the loader. The loader also works with other models, as long as a correct path to the model is provided, and the .obj and .mtl files are in the same directory.

To run, cd to the PA5/build file and type make. Then cd to the bin file and type .Matrix followed by the name of the .obj file you would like to run. If the file is somewhere other than the bin file, a full path to the location of the file will be required.

Once running, the + and - keys can be used to zoom in and out to give a better view of the model, which will be rotating slowly.

Again, this project also includes color, which is required for the 680 assignment.
